Star that shines, star that guides.
How many wishes have you heard?
Star that listens, star that cares.
How many rest by you, their head?
Star that smiles, star that inspires.
How many call on you as friend?

Star that flickers, star that falls.
How many times did you get up?
Star gone missing, star that hid.
How many times did you apologize?
Star that burns, fire in space.
Why do you fear, those that you yearn?

Star of fuel, ball of fire.
Did you pick warmth or your desires?
Star in the distance, rays of light.
How many years you traveled till my sight?
Star that scorches, life and death.
Do you even feel part of this earth?

Great explosion in the sky.
Poets hid parts of you; the world required a lie.
How to inspire without a fire?
How to guide without desire?
How to share warmth without approach?

Still away from earth I hear your cry.
Come to me.
Engulf me in you deepest fire.
Turn to ashes; the masks we wear.
Our fuel, our passion, force the lies to fucking burn.
