## Ode to the void I lost.  
  
A person told me they wish to see these words.  
And I thought about the fire with which I burn all the parts of me that yearn.  
7 voices I have heard this last few days  
Each of them in longing of the something that never were.  
I think about the silence they spoke, the parts of us we all think we broke.  
  
I sit outside alone at night.  
Like a hundred times before, I put on the same song.  
I raise my glasses so that the trees across become a blur.  
Try to use the guitar to reach out to the certainty I used to be.  
But it feels too far a way to touch anymore.  
  
Yesterday I told someone this song is my home.  
Is it now gone?  
  
The blurry trees change.  
To stars seen from a crooked tent.  
To the wall across my old balcony.  
To an old yellow brick building in an old square.  
To desserts, to seas, to hills, to places I have  forgotten where they were.  
Behind me screams of light, discordant joy, halls of life.  
And I always at night, outside, alone.   
My home in my ears; Its warmth to guide me back to were I belong.  
But tonight behind me there is only an empty hotel room.  
And I know what is missing now.  
  
From a blurry chaos to the void I painted,  
I like the lack of shapes my eyes have  
casted over you.  
  
From a horrid monster to the void I ate,  
I like how small you seem to the worlds I destroyed within me.  
  
From a pool of sadness to the void I drowned,  
I like my tears, my solitude, my fears that swallowed you whole.  
  
From an old soul to the void I lost,  
I like how far you are.  
I do not miss you anymore.  
  
I do no longer care, where the I that used to hold you, wanted to go.  
I do not care if he would like the mess that took your place.  
  
I may not like what lies there now, but I like how it came to be.  
Like the little moth, I will be free.  
I'll see what awaits after the flame.  
  
The home ends and as the voices the trees emerge from the memories, they become real again.  
  
I smile at how futile the real world is.  
And play the song again.
