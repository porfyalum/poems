I run from the nightmare  
I close to its face the door behind me  
I am here again  
Awake  
Within the mishappen hills  
Upon the purple fields  

I know the way well  
I reach the old music machine  
I turn it on  
The strings start first  
Then the percussion  
Wind blows  
Dust stirs upon the empty tunnels  
Notes fill the central pump  
It turns on  

I move to the central hall  
The pump has overflown the window lids again  
I can feel the water of the walls  
I tend to them a while  
Following the rhythm, lest I drown  

The windows open  
They move  
They shine light to the blank above  
Then focus on the brush strokes  
On the passion of the dancers on the wall  
Time to up the tempo  
Time for the brass  
Time for the pump to dance  

Almost powered up now  
The hills themselves they shake  
The cat gets scared  
And runs from the field  

I let a small smile slip  
I get up and put on my slippers  
There are things to be done  
Another morning  
Another time that I am nothing  
But a broken husk  
That turns art  
Into the will to live.
