My desert has 7 words.  
They bloomed in hate,  
Your gift to me planted from the start.  


My dessert follows me every time I try to leave it.  
I built it myself, cause it was easier.  
Junk and flotsam the sea around built its walls.  


I wanted to leave it as a kid  
They laughter kept me in it,  
Has it been shame or fear that made me safe in here?  


My thirst, it drove me mad  
It made me want to eat myself  
Become sand like me, the desert said.  


You were the first to cross it  
You liked digging holes in my sand  
My desert was your little playpen.  


After your seeds bloomed  
The words became a roots that strangle  
Nightmare that feeds and pulls me in.  


Every oasis I have met I feel it made me drier.  
Every attempt I walk further from the words.  
Every step away it feels a little heavier  
And every time I trip they call to me   
I hate being in that room again
