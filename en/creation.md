Every time you brag about me  
All I remember is how whenever I shared  
Something that made me feel alone  
A monster, with nowhere to belong  
You said it is a sign of intelligence.  

Every time you call me beatiful  
All I see is how when I destroyed on me  
Everything that made me feel good  
Out of fear for those that laughed  
You were proud of my choice.  

Every time you say  
You know me better than myself  
All I think is how when I offered  
To tell you who I am  
You said you didn't want to know.  

Every time you give me that look  
All I wisper is when to you I cried  
That you make me feel so small  
I wish I never existed;  
That I want to die.  

Every time you scold me  
All I hear is how you replied  
You are too old to change  
So I should figure it out  
Alone with my therapist.  

Every time you say  
You wished we had a better relationship  
I don't believe you.
