Red rays of dawn  
Parting me from home  
Struggling to hold the clouds afloat  
Lest my worries sink the flying boat  

Arriving to the land of fae  
They smile at me like I belong
I hop with them to the banquet   
And to the table I pull a chair  

As I shuffle the cards I'm dealt  
The table twists and turns  
Shuffles both guest and itself  

Parade grotesque, parade of dreams  
Goddesses and elves  
Dwarves and pixies  
Deer and fish  
Dance all around me.  
Take the memories away  
Turn my worries to what you wish.   

Memories of home escape my thought  
All whisked away except of you;   awaiting my return  
Yours I feely share for the fae to feast  
But also keep inside me.  

The bell rings the dance complete.  
All tired and happy, we part ways.  

Red rays of dawn  
pull me back to where I'm from  
Carrying the legends I now hold  
Joyful tears cross my face, so bold  

Standing at the precipice   
Between the magical and you  
How can I be nostalgic  
For both where I was  
And where I am coming back to
