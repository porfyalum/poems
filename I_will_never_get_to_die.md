I will never get to die.

My corpse will never wear my clothes.
Only a costume.
My funeral won't have open laughter.
Only hidden in shame.
My eulogy will be full of soft words,
spoken by those that hate me.
My body will never become part of the world.
It will just rot in a wooden box.
My weirdnessâ€”all my little quirks
will be cut to fit some strangers' grief.
My love for you all will be perverted 
to honor a divine full of hatred.
My life long quest to see me whole,
will never fit inside that hole.

I will never get to die. 
Only my masks will.
Even those I threw away.
In pomp and ritual to be preserved.

So I exist only alive.
And deep in memories of friends that choose to keep me.
I have no choice but find a way to survive.
A way for all of us to thrive.
 
I guess this is why all monsters have no souls.
Their essence is gone with them.

I guess this is why all monsters have eternal life.
In death we all are forced to belong.
